Things that would be cool to do:

  - Verify with someone who knows Morse code whether the output is useful
  - Support > 8-bit unsigned audio buffers
  - Support other waveforms than sine
  - Allow changing the volume/amplitude of the beeps
  - Test on OSX and Windows
  - Make some packages and bundles so people don't need to compile
  - Allow saving playback to an audio file
  - Decoding Morse code from audio/file input
